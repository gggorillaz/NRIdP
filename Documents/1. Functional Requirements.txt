1. Functional Requirements:
1.1. User Registration and Profile Management:
User Registration:

	Collect user information: First name, last name, email, password, etc.
	Validation of input data: Check if the email is in the correct format, password strength, etc.
	Send a confirmation email to the user to verify their email address.
	Store user data securely in the database.

User Login:

	Allow users to log in using their email and password.
	Implement account lockout after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts.

Password Reset:

	Allow users to reset their password if forgotten.
	Send a password reset link or code to their registered email.

Profile Management:

	Allow users to view their profile information.
	Provide the option to update profile details like name, email, etc.
	Allow users to change their password.


1.2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
MFA Setup:

	Allow users to set up MFA during registration or through their profile settings.
	Support for various MFA methods, e.g., SMS, Authenticator apps, etc.

MFA During Login:

	If MFA is enabled for a user, prompt for the second factor after successful password validation.
	Provide a fallback option or method if the primary MFA method fails (e.g., using backup codes).


MFA Management:

	Allow users to turn MFA on or off.
	Allow users to change their MFA method.
	Provide backup codes for users.



1.3. Token Issuance:
Token Generation:

	Generate a JWT (or similar) after a successful authentication.
	The token should contain relevant claims, e.g., user ID, roles, expiration time, etc.

Token Validation:

	APIs or services using the token should be able to validate it.
	Check for token expiration, signature, etc.

Token Revocation:

	Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if needed (e.g., user logs out or changes their password).



2. Non-functional Requirements:
Security:

	All data transmissions must be encrypted (HTTPS).
	Passwords should be stored using a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
	Tokens should be securely signed, and sensitive data within tokens should be encrypted.


Performance:

	The system should respond quickly to user interactions. For instance, token issuance after login should not take more than 	a few seconds.
	The system should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users.


Scalability:

	The system should be designed to scale horizontally, allowing for increased loads by adding more servers or instances.


Availability:

	Aim for high availability, ensuring that the system remains operational even if one or more components fail.


Maintainability:

	The codebase should be well-organized, commented, and modular, allowing for easy updates and fixes.


Usability:

	The user interface (even if it's a basic one) should be intuitive and user-friendly.


Backup and Recovery:

	Regular backups of user data and system configurations should be taken.
	There should be a recovery plan in case of any failures or data loss.
